# Biomedical_images

## Basic file formats

__.dcm__ file (DICOM-Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine): __Standard format__ for medical images 

__.nii__ (NIfTI-Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative-): for __fMRI,MRI__. Supporting 3D/4D data

__.mhd__ :Information description file

__.raw__ : __Binary data__ for .mhd 

__.mha__ :Similar with .mhd/.raw, but describe image and information inton __one single file__

__.nrrd__ (nearly raw raster data): high dimension data, for visualization and image process.

__.jpg/.jpeg__: Compressed format. Lossy, not suitable for medical image analysis

__.tiff/ .tif__: Lossless and supports multi-page, 16-bit depth. Common in microscopy and high-quality biomedical imaging.

## AI for medical images

#### 1. Image Classification

__CNN__ : Convolutional Neural Networks.
__Transformer__ :
__ViT__ : Vision Transformer

#### 2. Semantic Segmentation
Segment anatomical structures or lesions pixel-by-pixel
